An object detection task using YOLOv8 to identify objects in a single image.  
- **Example:** Detecting a bus in an image  
- **Model:** YOLOv8  
- **Applications:** Static image analysis, quick object detection demos  

###  Task 2 — Segmentation
Image and video segmentation using YOLOv8-seg to separate objects from the background.  
- **Model:** YOLOv8-seg  
- **Features:** Pixel-level object segmentation  
- **Applications:** Background removal, video object tracking  


###  Task 3 — Training on African Wildlife Dataset
Training YOLOv8 on a custom African Wildlife dataset for object detection.  
- **Model:** YOLOv8  
- **Dataset:** African Wildlife dataset  
- **Applications:** Wildlife research, species monitoring, conservation  

### Task 4 — Vehicle Object Detection

   A YOLOv8-based deep learning project to detect various types of vehicles in images and videos.  
   - **Model:** YOLOv8  
   - **Features:** Real-time detection, high accuracy for multiple vehicle classes  
   - **Dataset:** Custom annotated dataset  
   - **Applications:** Traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicles, surveillance  

### IIITH_Project — Brain Tumor Detection
