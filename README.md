##  Contents

1. [Task 1: Image Detection](./yolov8-image-detection/README.md)  
   - Object detection on a single image (e.g., a bus)

2. [Task 2: Segmentation](./ultralytics-segmentation/README.md)  
   - Image and video segmentation using YOLOv8-seg

3. [Task 3: Training](./african-wildlife-detection/README.md)  
   - Training YOLOv8 on a custom African Wildlife dataset

4.Task 4 — Vehicle Object Detection

   A YOLOv8-based deep learning project to detect various types of vehicles in images and videos.  
   - **Model:** YOLOv8  
   - **Features:** Real-time detection, high accuracy for multiple vehicle classes  
   - **Dataset:** Custom annotated dataset  
   - **Applications:** Traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicles, surveillance  

IIITH_Project — Brain Tumor Detection
   A medical imaging project using YOLOv11 for brain tumor detection from MRI scans.  
   - **Model:** YOLOv11  
   - **Features:** Detects tumor presence and localizes affected regions  
   - **Dataset:** Annotated MRI brain tumor dataset  
   - **Applications:** Healthcare diagnostics, early detection support
